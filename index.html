            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>My name is Michael Sommer and I work in the fast-paced, exciting field of digital marketing.
                        I started my career in digital marketing while in college at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.
                        I studied advertising in school but was drawn more to its parent field of marketing.</p>

                <h3>Rockford Area Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau</h3>

                    <p>My first job in digital marketing was at the Rockford Area Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau.
                       I started working at the RACVB in the summer of 2010 as the Marketing &amp; Communications Intern.
                       The RACVB helps promote Rockford, Illinois as a place to visit and host events.
                       Rockford is the soccer capital in Illinois so we hosted many, many large soccer tournaments.
                       Rockford is also home to several large baseball, softball, volleyball, bowling, and even fishing tournaments.
                       The Rock River produces some monster catfish that fisherman dream of catching.</p> 
                    <p>My main responsibility was managing the company’s Facebook and Twitter channels.
                       I also wrote a weekly article that was published on the website and promoted through social media.
                       The article (Michael’s Picks of the Week) included my top 5 list of things to do in the Rockford area for that week.
                       I also did some basic analytical work and data entry with our CRM.
                       I enjoyed the internship enough to return the following summer.</p>
                    <p>I had similar responsibilities in the summer of 2011.
                       However, I also started going to some of the events that I was helping promote.
                       This gave me some experience with event planning.
                       I enjoyed the opportunity to get out of the office and away from my computer from time to time.</p>
                    <p>I returned during the winter of 2011 while on break from school.
                       My last day at the CVB was in January of 2012.
                       I learned a lot during my internship tenure and appreciated the opportunity to help promote my hometown.</p>

                <h3>The Canopy Club</h3>

                    <p>My second job in digital marketing was at The Canopy Club in Urbana, Illinois.</em></figcaption>
                       The Canopy Club is The Pageant of Urbana-Champaign.
                       I started working at The Canopy Club in the Summer of 2010 as a Marketing &amp; Communications Intern.</p>
                    <p>My main responsibilities involved promoting shows through social media, pulling data from Google Analytics, and updating the website.
                       Although the internship was unpaid, I was also able to attend any of their concerts for free.
                       I enjoyed the internship and continued to work through the winter of 2012.</p>
                    <p>In the summer of 2011, I was offered a special project to work the annual Summer Camp Music Festival.
                       This was a week long opportunity that included driving artists from their hotels to the venue and back to the airport.
                       This also gave me additional experience with event planning.</p>

                <h3>Captiva Marketing</h3>

                    <p>I moved to St. Louis in 2012 less than a week after graduating from college and started working at Captiva Marketing as an Online Marketing Specialist.
                       Captiva is a full-service digital marketing agency focusing on lead generation.
                       The company employs around 30 professionals and is located in Sunset Hills.</p>
                    <p>As an Online Marketing Specialist, my main responsibility included building out websites through or internal CMS called Empoweren, optimizing these websites (SEO), promoting these websites through various channels, and pulling data from Google Analytics.
                        I helped support several Account Managers on projects for both small and large accounts.
                        I was promoted to Account Manager within a year of my start date.</p>  
                    <p>As an Account Manager, I was given several smaller clients/accounts to manage and grow.
                       I provided monthly reports and recommendations to my clients.
                       I would meet with them to review current projects or discuss any new projects.
                       I also started managing people since Online Marketing Specialists helped support my clients as my work continued to grow.</p> 
                    <p>After working as an Account Manager for a few years, I was promoted to Digital Marketing Strategist.
                       My new role involved creating comprehensive digital marketing strategies including overviews of my clients’ target markets, the best channels to reach these markets, and the most effective content to connect with potential customers.
                       From there, I worked with our internal teams (design, development, and account management) to execute these plans.</p>
                    <p>I enjoyed my time at Captiva and learned a lot about digital marketing and marketing in general.
                       The agency world forces you to learn very quickly and wear several hats at once.
                       I worked there for over 4 years before accepting a position with Barnes-Jewish Hospital.</p>

                <h3>Barnes-Jewish Hospital</h3>

                    <p>I started working as a Senior Digital Marketing Coordinator at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in the fall of 2016.
                       Barnes-Jewish Hospital is currently ranked #12 on the U.S. News list of best hospitals in the nation.
                       My department helps bring in new patients while also distributing both internal and external content.</p>
                    <p>In my current role, my main responsibility is managing the hospital’s paid digital advertising efforts through various Google platforms and Facebook.
                       I provide reports to service line leads to help highlight these efforts so they can share with the physicians.
                       My team is also responsible for the website and any video efforts that come through our department.</p>
                <h3 class="end">What's Next?</h3>
                    <p>Although I have been working with developers my entire career, I never thought I would want to become one.
                       The book “Zero to One” by Peter Thiel inspired me to build and create something new.
                       Peter Thiel is a developer and I continued reading books written by developers (by accident).
                       I then heard about LaunchCode and realized I could actually learn how to code.
                       The program seemed very exciting to me so I decided to apply and started a few weeks later.</p>
                    <p>I’m hoping to become a software developer/engineer after completing the LC101 program.
                       I don’t know what type of software I want to work on yet.
                       The idea of building, creating, modifying, improving, and deploying new software feels very rewarding to me.</p>
